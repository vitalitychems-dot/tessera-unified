 *                            signed out (`isPending: false`). Session comes from

 *                            (cookie when deployed; bearer in live preview).
 *   - Auth disabled or unconfigured -> no user, never a fabricated shared
 *     identity. The UI can continue showing the public catalog.
 *
 * Protect a route by waiting out `isPending` before acting on `user` —
 * redirecting on `user: null` alone bounces signed-in visitors to sign-in on
 * every hard reload:
 *
 *   import { RedirectToSignIn } from "@/lib/auth/gates";
 *   const { user, isPending } = useCurrentUserState();
 *   if (isPending) return null;              // still resolving — don't redirect yet
 *   if (!user) return <RedirectToSignIn />;  // definitely signed out
 *
 * `authEnabled` is a module-level constant fixed at load, so the guarded hook
 * call keeps a stable hook order across every render of a given component.
